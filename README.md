# Data Science Experiments

A compilation of many small projects. For now, they are primarily from the [Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/) with some additional exploration. [Loans Prediction](machine-learning/final_loans.ipynb)  is the largest project of the course, putting together data analysis and deep learning techniques to predict payback on loans.
